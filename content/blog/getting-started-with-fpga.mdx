# Getting Started with FPGA Development

Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are incredible devices that allow you to implement custom digital circuits. In this comprehensive guide, we'll cover everything you need to get started with FPGA development.

## What is an FPGA?

An FPGA is an integrated circuit designed to be configured after manufacturing. Unlike processors that execute software instructions, FPGAs can be programmed to implement any digital circuit, making them incredibly versatile.

## Why Learn FPGAs?

- **Performance**: Parallel processing capabilities
- **Flexibility**: Reconfigurable hardware
- **Real-time**: Deterministic timing behavior
- **Career**: High demand in many industries

## Getting Started

### Required Tools

1. **Development Board**: Xilinx Artix-7, Intel MAX10, or Lattice iCE40
2. **Software**: Vivado (Xilinx), Quartus (Intel), or open-source tools
3. **HDL Knowledge**: Verilog or VHDL

### First Project: LED Blinker

```verilog
module led_blink (
    input  wire clk,
    input  wire rst_n,
    output reg  led
);
    reg [25:0] counter;
    
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            counter <= 0;
            led <= 0;
        end else begin
            counter <= counter + 1;
            if (counter == 0)
                led <= ~led;
        end
    end
endmodule
```
